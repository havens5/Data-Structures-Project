## Introduction
Previously in stacks and dynamic arrays we see that they are all *stored in memory right next to one another*. This make for quick access of items and this is the same for a queue, set, and map. A **Linked List** on the other hand is *stored in a random way in memory*. Each element is called a **Node**. Each node contains the address of the next node in the list. When using the same analogy as stacks, each scoop of ice cream will have the location of the next scoop of ice cream.
